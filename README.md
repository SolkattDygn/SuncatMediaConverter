# SuncatMediaConverter
Converts video file audio codec to a video file with other codec

Created to tun in a bash script on linux in order to facilitate a 
more enjoyable experience converting the audio codec in videofiles.

Originally created to convert videofiles (.mp4/.mkv) with AAC audio codec to 
a videofile with a PCM codec so it can be used in Davinci Resolve Studio
running on Linux.

The idea is to extend on that idea by bringing more covert options to the
table like converting the audio codec to opus etc. The Idea to extract 
just the audio from a videofiles and save it as .mp3 in a desired bitrate
was also added to the options.
